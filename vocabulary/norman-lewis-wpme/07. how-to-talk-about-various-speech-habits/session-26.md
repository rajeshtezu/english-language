## a spartan virtue

**FUN FACT**

```
In ancient sparta, originally known as Laconia, when philip or Macedonia was storming the gates of
sparta (Laconia), he sent a message to the besieged king saying, "If we capture your city we will
burn it to the ground." A one-word answer came back: "If." It was now probably philip's turn to be
speechless, though history does not record his reaction.

  It is from the name Laconic that we derive our word laconic - pithy, concise, economical in the
use of words almost to the point of curtness; precisely the opposite of verbose.
```

- `laconic`
  - `laconicness`
  - `laconicity`
  - `laconism`
  - `laconicism`

## brilliant

- `cogent`: a term of admiration. A cogent argument is well put, convincing, hardly short of brilliant.
- `cogency` shows a keen mind, an ability to think clearly and logically.
  > ```
  > Latin root:   cogo
  >             (to drive together, compel, force)
  > ```

## back to talk

> ```
> Latin root:   loquor
>             (to speak)
> ```

- `eloquent`: this person speaks out, is vividly expressive, fluent, forceful, or persuasive in language.

  > The word is partially synonymous with cogent, but cogent implies irresistible logical reasoning and intellectual keenness, while eloquent suggests artistic expression, strong emotion appeal, the skillful use of language to move and arouse a listener.

- `magniloquent` and `grandiloquent` : both are virtually identical in meaning

  - the use of high-flown, grandiose, even pompous language; of large and impressive words; of lofty; flowery; or over elegant phraseology.

  > ```
  > root:
  >       - magnus (large)
  >       - grandis (grand)
  > ```
