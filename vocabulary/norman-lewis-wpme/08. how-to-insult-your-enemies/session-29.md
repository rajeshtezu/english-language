more fanatic drillmaster. france had ever seen it was from this time that the french army's

```
Sycophant comes to us from greeks. According to shipley's dictionary of word origins.
When a fellow wants to get a good mark, he may polish up an apple and place it on the
teacher's desk; his classmate call such a lad an apple-shiner. less complimentary
localites use the term bootlicker.

The greeks had a name for it: fig-shower.

This was the fellow that informed the officers in charge when
  1. the figs in the sacred groves were being taken.
  2. when the smyrna fig-dealers were dodging the tariff.

       > ```

     - `antonym`: a word of opposite meaning, etymologically "an against name"
     - `homonym`: a word that sounds like another but has a different meaning and spelling

     in hand - it is therefore not surprisingly that the word for marriage should be
     built on the latin root for mother.
