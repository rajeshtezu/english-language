 HOW TO FLATTER YOUR FRIENDS

 S-32

 (1) Put the kettle on , polly: 

   - convivial (adj) : they are friendly, happy, extroverts, and gregarious.

  (2) you can't tire them :
    
    - indefatigable :  they apparently have boundless illimitable energy -- they are on the go from morning to night, and often far into the night ,
                       working hard, playing hard, never tiring, never "pooped" or "bushed" -- and getting twice as much done as any three other human beings.

  (3) no tricks, no secrets : 

    - ingenuous : they are pleasingly frank, utterly lacking in pretense or artificially in fact quite unable to hide their feelings or thoughts-- and so honest
                  and aboveboard that they can scarcely conceive of trickery, chicanery, or dissimulation in anyone. There is, then about them the simple
                  naturalness and unsophistication of child.

 (4) sharp as a razor : 
    
    - perspicacious : they have minds like steel traps; their insight into problems that would confuse or  mystify people of less keenness or discernment is just short of amazing

  (5) no placating necessary : 
     
      - magnanimous : they are most generous about forgiving a slight, an insult, an injury. Never do they harbor resentment, store up petty grudges, or waste energy or thought on means of revenge or retaliation.  How could they? they are much too big  hearted.

  (6) one person orchestras : 

     - versatile :  they are masters of all traders.
  
  (7) no grumbling : 

     - stoical : they bear their troubles bravely, never ask for sympathy, never yield to sorrow, never wince at pain. It sounds almost superhuman, but it's true.

  (8) no fear:
     
      - intrepid : they are strangers to fear, they are audacious, dauntless, contemptuous of danger and hardship.

  (9) no dullness : 

     - scintillating : they are witty, clever, delightful; and naturally they are also brilliant and entertaining conversationalist.

  (10) city slickers : 

     - urbane : they are cultivated, poised, tactful, socially so experienced, sophisticated, and courteous that they are at home in any group, at ease under all circumstances of social intercourse. You cannot help admiring (perhaps envying) their smoothness and self-assurance, their tact and congeniality.
