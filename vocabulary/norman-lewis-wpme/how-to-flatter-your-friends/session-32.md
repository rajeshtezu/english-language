## no tricks, no secrets

- `ingenuous` : they are pleasingly frank, utterly lacking in pretense or artificially in fact quite unable to hide their feelings or thoughts-- and so honest and aboveboard that they can scarcely conceive of trickery, chicanery, or dissimulation in anyone. There is, then about them the simple naturalness and unsophistication of child.
