S - 40

(1) money, and what it will buy:

    - pennry: dire, object poverty, complete lack of financial resources
              -> it is one of the two strongest english words there are to denote absence of money.

    - penurious(adj): stingy, close-fisted, niggardly; so sparing in the use of money as to give the appearance of pennry.
                      -> penurious (twice as stingy) is a synonym of parsimonious (stingy), but is much stronger in implications.
                               - penuriousness: stingyness, excessive frugality
                               - parsimony(noun)
    
    - indigence: a somewhat milder word than pennry for poverty.
                 -> indigent people are not absolutely penniless - they are simply living in reduced circumstances.
    
    - destitution: a close synonym of pennry, and one of equal strength.
                   - destitute people do not even have the means for mere subsistence - as such, they are on the verge of starvation.
                
    - affluence: the possession of money, especially in increasing amounts.
                 - affluent people, people of affluence, or those living in affluent circumstances, are more than comfortable; in addition, there is the implication that their wealth is increasing.
                    
                      root [ad- (af-) (to, towards) + fluo (to flow)]

    - opulence:  much stronger term than affluence, which not only implies much greater wealth than affluence, but in addition suggests lavish expenditures and ostentatiously luxurious surroundings.
    people of opulence ows estates; drive only outrageously expensive and specially equipped cars (Rolls-Royce, mercedes-benzes, porsches,etc)

            - opulent: may describe people, surroundings, style of life, or the like
                       latin [opulentus (wealthy)]

            - confluence: a "flowing together"

            - fluent: the words flow smoothly.


(2) doing and feeling: 

    - vicarious fatigue: if you watch a furious athletic event, and you get tired, though the athlete expend all the energy.
    - vicarious intoxication: if your friend goes on a bender, and as you watch him absorb one drink after another, you begin to feel giddy and stimulated.
    - vicarious torment: if you watch a mother in a motion picture or dramatic play suffer horribly at the death of her child, and you go through the same agony.
                         [living vicariously => living at second hand]

(3) time is relative: 

   -> dayfly: a short-lived creature
              -> called ephemera in greek
                         -> ephemeral: anything so short-lived
    

    - evanescent: synonym of ephemeral
                  - staying for remarkably short time, vanishing
                  - something intangible, like a feeling, may be called evanescent. It's here and before you can quite comprehend it, it's gone-vanished.
                  - evanescence (noun)
                  - evanesce (verb)

                root: [e - (ex-) {prefix -> out} + vanesco (to vanish) + -ent (suffix)]

                -> the suffix -esce often, but not always, means begin to
                -> -exent may mean becoming or becoming to

    (5) exploration of modes of expression: 
       
       - badinage: a half-teasing, non-malicious, frivolous banter, intended to amuse rather than wound.
       - persiflage: a close synonym of badinage, which is a little more derisive, a trifle more indicative of contempt or mockery -  but still totally unmalicious.
       - cliche: a pattern of words which was once new and fresh, but which now is so old, worn, and threadbare that only banal, unimaginative speakers and writers ever use it.
       - bromide: any trite,  dull, and probably fallacious remark that shows little evidence of original thinking, and that therefore convinces a listener of the total absence of perspicacity on the part of the speaker.

       - platitude: similar to a cliche or bromide - but, to add insult to injury (cliche), the speaker uses it with an air of novelty - as if the just made it up, and isn't he the brilliant fellow!
       - anodyne: [medical] a drug that always pain without curing an illness, like aspirin or morphine
                  [figuratively] a statement made to allay someone, fear or anxieties, not believed by the speaker, but intended to be believed by the listener
                  greek: odyne (pain)

"prosperity just around the corner" was a popular anodyne of the 1930s.
