## money, and what it will buy

- `penury`: dire, object poverty, complete lack of financial resources

  - it is one of the two strongest english words there are to denote absence of money.

- `penurious` (adj): stingy, close-fisted, niggardly; so sparing in the use of money as to give the appearance of penury.

  > penurious (twice as stingy) is a synonym of parsimonious (stingy), but is much stronger in implications.

  - `penuriousness`: stingyness, excessive frugality
  - `parsimony` (noun)

- `indigence`: a somewhat milder word than penury for poverty.
  > indigent people are not absolutely penniless - they are simply living in reduced circumstances.
- `destitution`: a close synonym of penury, and one of equal strength.
  > destitute people do not even have the means for mere subsistence - as such, they are on the verge of starvation.
- `affluence`: the possession of money, especially in increasing amounts.

  > affluent people, people of affluence, or those living in affluent circumstances, are more than comfortable; in addition, there is the implication that their wealth is increasing.

  > ```
  > root:  ad- (af-)   +   fluo
  >       (to, towards)    (to flow)
  > ```

- `opulence`: much stronger term than affluence, which not only implies much greater wealth than affluence, but in addition suggests lavish expenditures and ostentatiously luxurious surroundings.
  People of opulence ows estates; drive only outrageously expensive and specially equipped cars (Rolls-Royce, mercedes-benzes, porsches,etc)

- `opulent`: may describe people, surroundings, style of life, or the like

  > latin root: opulentus (wealthy)

> root:  e- (ex-)       +   vanesco      +   -ent
>       (prefix -> out)     (to vanish)     (suffix)
